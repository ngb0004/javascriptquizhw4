Javascript Quiz application.

# Overview
I built a simple quiz application using javascript. It has a start button that starts the timer and shuffles to a random question. each time you complete a question the screen behind it flashes either red or green for half a second based on whether it was correct or not before moving on to the next question. At the end of the quiz you can add your name to the list of high scores and restart the quiz if you like.

# Issues
There was a lot I learned while building this quiz but there was a lot of bugs that I couldn't figure out. The higscores button seems to mess with the timer and cause it to get off of the time interval, it still sort of works but not as I wish. The highscores button doesn't work until you have seen the highscores page so I don't know why that is the case. When you restart the quiz it also does somthing weird to the timer. These are the main issues I was unable to resolve.
